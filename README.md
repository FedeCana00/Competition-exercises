# Competition-exercises
## Introduction
In this repository there are concurrency exercises done in the university course Real Time Systems Embedded.
The C language and the pthread.h library are used.
## Deployment
To be able to try the programs locally after downloading all the contents of this repository, just open the LINUX terminal with cd referring to the folder where the programs are saved and type the following commands:
```
make
./program-name
```
Theoretically it can also be performed on MacOS operating systems (since they are based on UNIX). However, running the program shows that it runs wrong!
